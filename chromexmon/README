chromexmon is an activity monitor for X11 servers running in a chroot
in Chrome OS.
 
The program is split in two components communicating indirectly by
modifying chrome OS power manager configuration directory. The X11
program chrootxmon.py monitors user activity. It modifies the power
manager runtime configuration files [1]. These changes are monitored
by the Chrome OS daemon powermanconf_monitor.sh. The Chrome OS daemon
restarts the power manager each time the contents of the files that
specify the screen dimming/turning off and computer suspend delays [1]
change (including modification date). While the user is active in the
chrooted X11, the X11 program increases the "dimming", "off" and
"suspend" timeouts to (configurable) high values to prevent the screen
to dim or turn off and the computer to suspend. When the user has been
inactive in the chroot X11 for a configurable duration, the X11
watchdog restores the power manager configuration files to lower
values and the Chrome OS daemon restarts the Chrome OS power manager
when noticing this change.
